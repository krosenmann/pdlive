*FOLDER CONTENTS*

*ADC*			
  implies a mic, those may as well be used as effects


*Control Patchs* 		
   are patchs that uses data as input and or output (they do not produce audio signals). They are used to sequence actions read midi files, transform your keyboard into a virtual piano or do analysis of data (markov chain, generate data (generating scales, or chords)).


*Drums*			
   are drum sequencers using synthesis and samples, see the name


*Dss*	
   are a set of experimental patch to use drawings as data to structures to control 	playback of a sample or synthesis parameters.


*Factory*			
  are a set of patchs to do noises, for sound design and "concrete sounds"


*FX*				
  a big collection of mono/stereo effects (see the name)


*Sampler*			
  patchs that are sample based, from basic playback to slicer machine or 		Vocoder, Convolution


*Synth*			
  a big collection of synth polyphonic or monophonic, for synthetic sounds and "musical instruments"


*z_usefull_abs*		
  contains important abstractions or things that are important to understand how to adapt patches to use in pdlive, such as _armfloat_, _audiobuses_, _Data-Gate_, those are used in almost every patch as hardcoded subpatches to avoid dependencies.
 



then a flag system is used in the name of patches :

		- *_Sample_* (you'll need to load samples), 

		- *_Midi_* (playable with a controller or sequencers), 

		- *_Generative_* (will generate sound  or control data themselves), 

		- *_Seq_* (indicates that a sequencer is included in the patch),

		- *_tech_* (indicates that this patch is good to be studied to learn     more  about sound synthesis techniques).


The list of patches given hereby is not exhaustive, this is just to give you an idea (with snapshots) of what you get.
