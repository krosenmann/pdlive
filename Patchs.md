**FOLDER CONTENTS**

---

**ADC**
> implies a mic, those may as well be used as effects


---

**Control Patchs**
> are patchs that uses data as input and or output (they do not produce audio signals). They are used to sequence actions read midi files, transform your keyboard into a virtual piano or do analysis of data (markov chain, generate data (generating scales, or chords)).


---

**Drums**
> are drum sequencers using synthesis and samples, see the name


---

**Dss**
> are a set of experimental patch to use drawings as data to structures to control 	playback of a sample or synthesis parameters.


---

**Factory**
> are a set of patchs to do noises, for sound design and "concrete sounds"


---

**FX**
> a big collection of mono/stereo effects (see the name)


---

**Sampler**
> patchs that are sample based, from basic playback to slicer machine or 		Vocoder, Convolution


---

**Synth**
> a big collection of synth polyphonic or monophonic, for synthetic sounds and "musical instruments"


---

**z\_usefull\_abs**
> contains important abstractions or things that are important to understand how to adapt patches to use in pdlive, such as _armfloat_, _audiobuses_, _Data-Gate_, those are used in almost every patch as hardcoded subpatches to avoid dependencies.

then a flag system is used in the name of patches :

> - **_Sample_** (you'll need to load samples),

> - **_Midi_** (playable with a controller or sequencers),

> - **_Generative_** (will generate sound  or control data themselves),

> - **_Seq_** (indicates that a sequencer is included in the patch),

> - **_tech_** (indicates that this patch is good to be studied to learn     more  about sound synthesis techniques).

> - **_+pdL_** is used to indicate patches that I use most. Most of those have nice gui and/or are easy to use and/or are quite powerfull.

The list of patches given hereby is not exhaustive, this is just to give you an idea (with snapshots) of what you get.
