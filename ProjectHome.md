pdLive! is a set of patches that I took hereby and re-aranged to build an environnement to use pd as a live instrument, mixer, looper, effect ... sufitiently friendly. The environnement is develloped so that every loop recording and some effects can be synched to a Master metronome making things much more easy.

You'll also need some notions on how pure data works, as for example the throw and catch objects, and the s and r objects to follow the flow of data and signals. It's quite simple but if you don't know how those objects works you might be limited, you'll need to have a clear view of where signals and data come from and where you want them to go. You might also need to create, duplicate, rename some objects and rewire some connections.

note : no guarantee, some patches may cause the crash of Pd. Most of them are identifiable as they comport the flag -instable in their names but this may change regarding to the OS you use.

Thanks to the pd community for sharing their patchs and thus making this project possible.
